# Frontend Design Plugin

> Create distinctive, production-grade interfaces aligned with BOS design principles.

## What It Does

This plugin automatically activates when you're building frontend components. It helps you:

- **Make intentional aesthetic choices** — not generic "AI-generated" looks
- **Apply BOS design tokens** — warm neutrals, Aperol accents, proper typography
- **Think like a designer** — purpose, context, and that one memorable detail

## Quick Start

Just describe what you want to build:

```
"Create a dashboard for tracking brand assets"
"Build a settings panel with our design system"
"Design a card component for displaying projects"
```

Claude will:
1. Consider the purpose and context
2. Choose an aesthetic direction that fits
3. Apply BOS design tokens (colors, typography, borders)
4. Generate production-ready code

## BOS Design System

The plugin knows about our design system:

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Aperol** | `#FE5102` | CTAs, links, accents |
| **Charcoal** | `#191919` | Dark backgrounds |
| **Vanilla** | `#FFFAEE` | Light backgrounds |

Typography: **Neue Haas Grotesk** for headings/body, **Offbit** for accents

## Designer-Friendly Approach

This plugin speaks your language:

- Explains design decisions in plain terms
- Shows the "why" behind aesthetic choices
- Uses familiar design concepts (hierarchy, balance, rhythm)
- Suggests alternatives when appropriate
