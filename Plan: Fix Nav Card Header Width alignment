Plan: Fix Nav Card Header Width Alignment
Problem
On desktop viewports, scrolling content appears cut off on the left side of the nav card header. This happens because of a centering mismatch:

CardNav padding structure:

Outer nav: left-0 right-0 px-4 (full viewport with 16px padding = viewport - 32px)
Inner div: max-w-[var(--content-max-width)] centered within viewport - 32px
Content sections padding structure (OurLinks, FreeResources, RecentBlogs):

Main: px-4 (viewport - 32px content area)
Section: w-full px-4 (takes main's width, adds another 32px of padding)
Inner div: max-w-[var(--content-max-width)] centered within viewport - 64px
The nav card is centered within viewport - 32px, while content sections are centered within viewport - 64px. This creates a 16px horizontal offset where content appears closer to the left edge than the nav card.

Solution
Remove the redundant px-4 from content sections. Main already provides horizontal padding, so the sections don't need their own. This aligns both nav and content to be centered within viewport - 32px.

Files to Modify
1. OurLinks.tsx

- <section className="w-full mt-4 px-4">
+ <section className="w-full mt-4">
2. FreeResources.tsx

- <section className="w-full mt-6 sm:mt-8 px-4">
+ <section className="w-full mt-6 sm:mt-8">
3. RecentBlogs.tsx

- <section className="w-full mt-6 sm:mt-8 px-4">
+ <section className="w-full mt-6 sm:mt-8">
4. TechStack.tsx - No changes needed
TechStack already has the correct structure - it does not have px-4 on the section element. Instead it has px-4 on inner divs that wrap the max-width containers, which is the pattern the other components should follow. However, since main provides padding, removing section-level padding from the other components will achieve alignment.

Verification
Run dev server: bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 on a wide desktop viewport (1200px+)
Scroll the page and verify that content no longer appears cut off on the sides of the nav card header
Test on multiple viewport widths (768px, 1024px, 1440px) to ensure responsive behavior is preserved
Test mobile viewport to ensure layout still works correctly
Risk Assessment
Low risk: Only removing redundant padding that was causing misalignment
Main already provides px-4 padding, so content will still have proper horizontal spacing
TechStack already uses this pattern successfully
